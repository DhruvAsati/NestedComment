- **Edit Comments**: Users can edit their posted comments.
- **Delete Comments**: Users can delete their comments.
- **Reply to Comments**: Users can reply to any comment.
- **Character Counter**: A live character counter for both comments and replies with a maximum of 250 characters.
- **Responsive UI**: The layout is fully responsive, making it suitable for various screen sizes.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: For the basic structure of the page.
- **CSS**: Tailwind CSS for styling.
- **JavaScript**: For handling the logic of adding, editing, deleting, and replying to comments.
